## Use cases
#### In all user cases, scientists or engineers will benefit from a theoretical database of defect or impurity formation enthalpies and energy levels.
* A scientist would like to examine theoretical information on how certain defects such as vacancies, native or impurity interstitials or substitutions, surface states, and grain boundaries can influence their optoelectronic properties.
	* Native defects determine the equilibrium Fermi level in the semiconductor, and thus the nature of conductivity (p-type, n-type or intrinsic) and charge carriers.
* An engineer is designing a solar cell, photodiode, or another optoelectronic device and is looking to improve its efficiency and performance.  He or she would benefit from theoretical predictions of the electronic energy levels created by the impurities in the semiconductor.  Deep defect levels can be both disastrous and potentially beneficial:
	* **Drawbacks:** they could act as nonradiative recombination centers for minority charge carriers - reduces lifetime, impedes carrier collection/ light emission, and significantly decreases device efficiency and performance.
	* **Benefits:** in principle, they could be used as intermediate bands to facilitate absorption of sub-gap photons - enhace the absorption efficiencies.
