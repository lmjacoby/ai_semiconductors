## Use cases
#### In all user cases, scientists or engineers will benefit from our database of predicted formation energies and transition energies for thounsdands of semiconductor + impurity + defect site systems.

**Case 1**

A scientist would like to examine theoretically how certain substitutional or interstitial defect can influence a semiconductor's optoelectronic properties.
* Native defects determine the equilibrium Fermi level in the semiconductor, and thus the nature of conductivity (p-type, n-type or intrinsic) and charge carriers.
---
**Case 2**

An engineer is designing a solar cell, photodiode, or another optoelectronic device and is looking to improve its efficiency and performance.  He or she would benefit from theoretical predictions of the charge transition energy levels created by the impurities in the semiconductor.  Deep defect levels can be both disastrous and potentially beneficial:
* **Drawbacks:** they could act as nonradiative recombination centers for minority charge carriers - reduces lifetime, impedes carrier collection/ light emission, and significantly decreases device efficiency and performance.
* **Benefits:** in principle, they could be used as intermediate bands to facilitate absorption of sub-gap photons - enhace the absorption efficiencies.
